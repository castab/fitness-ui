# Fitness User Interface (UI)
This is the user interface to my fitness web application that tracks workouts, exercises, and sets.  This codebase uses Next.js as its primary framework, which is an extension of React.js.

### Requirements

- Node.js (This codebase uses v14.17.0)
- npm
- yarn

#### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn` to install packages
3. Run `docker-compose up` to bring up the necessary backend services.
4. Run `yarn dev` to spin up a development environment
5. Start changing code! (It'll hot-refresh as changes are made)
